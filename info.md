# UniLED - The Universal Light Controller


UniLED Currently supports the following range of cheap BLE addressable LED controllers:

- [SP107E][SP107E] 
- [SP601E][SP601E] 
- [SP611E][SP61xE]
- [SP617E][SP61xE]

## Important Notice

The Home Assistant component and platforms in this repository are in "Beta" release meaning this component is in the final stages of development, could be subject to frequent change, may contain bugs or unwanted "features".

This is my very first Python and Home Assistant component development.

HAVE FUN! ðŸ˜Ž

### HACS Automated Installation

You can install this component through [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) to easily receive updates.

### Manual Installation

1. Using the tool of choice open the directory (folder) for your HA configuration (where you find `configuration.yaml`).

3. In the `custom_components` directory (folder) create a new folder called `uniled`.
4. Download _all_ the files from the `custom_components/uniled/` directory (folder) in this repository.
5. Place the files you downloaded in the new directory (folder) you created.
6. Restart Home Assistant
