# ![HA][ha-logo] UniLED - The Universal Light Controller


UniLED Currently supports the following range of cheap BLE addressable LED controllers:

- SP107E 
- SP601E 
- [SP611E][SP61xE]
- [SP617E][SP61xE]

## Important Notice

The Home Assistant component and platforms in this repository are an "Alpha" release meaning this component is in the early stages of development,
will be subject to regular change, may cause issues with Home Assistant, contain bugs or unwanted "features". Use at your own risk!

This is also my very first Python and Home Assistant component development.

HAVE FUN! ðŸ˜Ž
